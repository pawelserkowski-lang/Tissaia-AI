# Agent Protocols (AGENTS.md)

This file contains instructions for AI agents (Jules) working on the Tissaia repository.

## 1. Workflow Automation
**Mandatory Submission Protocol:**
* At the conclusion of every task, you **MUST** automatically initiate the submission process.
* Use the `submit` tool to commit your changes.
* **Goal:** This action ensures that code is pushed to GitHub and a Pull Request is created automatically for every session.

## 2. Guideline Enforcement
* This file serves as the "code" that automates agent behavior.
* Do not deviate from this protocol unless explicitly instructed by the user.
